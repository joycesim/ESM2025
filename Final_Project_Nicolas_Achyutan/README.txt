Our introduction is partly in the Matlab file and partly in the Python file - the reason for this has to do with the structuring of the video. Outside of that, each file has its own conclusion and references. 

QBO_2 and QBO and textbook_im1 are images used in the ipynb file. There are also movie versions of the simulations that show the evolution of the system over time (on top of the regular images) - those are the 2 GIFs here.

finalprojectesm.txt contains a link to the video (that is too large for us to upload onto GitHub) and a link to a zip file containing the same repository as this one.
